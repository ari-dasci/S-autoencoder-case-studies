Autoencoder case studies
========================

**This is the supplementary software for the paper 'On the use of autoencoders for representation learning: Fundamentals and case studies'**

Inside this package, you will find 3 R examples and 2 Python examples:
  - Anomaly detection (UNSW-NB15 dataset)
  - Data embedding/visualization (datasets Satellite image and CPU Activity)
  - Hashing (Bibtex dataset)
  - Denoising (STL10 dataset)
  - Instance generation (AT&T faces dataset)

There are two additional prototypes for image compression and superresolution examples.
